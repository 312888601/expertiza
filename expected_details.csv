== Introduction paragraph ==
Slightly subjective. The statements ""Devise is simple to use .."", "".. can be used directly by developers"" and ""Devise saves a lot of time .."" are subjective and sounds promotional.

== Modules ==
- ""Perhaps the most important are the Devise modules which provides essential functionalities like enhanced securtiy"": this sentence sounds subjective because the word 'Perhaps' is used. Everything in a wikipage should be a stated fact, without ambiguity. Also, 'security' is spelt wrong.
- ""There are 10 modules listed on the official page of Devise by Plataformatec"" to ""There are 10 modules listed on the official page of Devise <cite the page>""
- ""Information regarding each module is listed in README as well as the Plataformatec website"" - A wikipage should contain the information rather than redirecting to the README of the project. A one-liner for each of the modules can be written similar to how it is in [https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication]

== Methods == 
The font for all of the method names, viz, 'authenticate_user!', 'before_action', 'current_user', 'user_signed_in', etc should be changed to 'Computer code' while in the 'Edit' mode.",3
25040,Wikipedia contribution_Team11,student6469,"Rate the English usage. Give a list of spelling, grammar, punctuation mistakes or language usage mistakes you can find in this wiki (e.g. ruby on rails -> Ruby on Rails).",3998,"There seems to be a lot of grammatical error in the sentences. Below are some of the errors:

== History ==
 - ""Devise is first introduced.. "" to ""Devise was first introduced.. "" => Grammar
 - ""Devise is one of the few authentication systems which support rack based applications and hence can support Rails 3 and up as they are completely rack based."" to ""Devise is one of the few authentication systems which supports rack based applications. Hence, it is compatible for Rails (version 3 and higher) as it is completely rack based."" => sentence structure, punctuation use, and shortened lengthy sentence
 - ""The latest version of Devise available is v3.5.3 and it is up to date with Rails 5 beta 2."" to ""The latest version of Devise is v3.5.3 and it is up to date with Rails 5 beta 2."" => grammar. Also, should ""Rails 5 beta 2"" be written as ""Rails 5.0.0.beta2""? (official version nomenclature)
- ""In Warden, the id which is a primary key of a user is somehow stored to match it later with the logged in user"" to ""In Warden, the id (which is a primary key of a user) is stored to match it later with the logged in user"" => removed the ambiguity in the sentence structure. Also, ""somehow stored"" doesn't sound good


== Installation == 
- ""Although Devise is very useful and reduces the amount of effort in developing authentication mechanisms significantly, it requires a good understanding of the Rails framework. Hence it is advised for beginners to not use Devise."" - This is a subjective statement.
- ""They are listed out below"" to ""They are listed below"" => usage
- Most of the instructions for the installation are in the second person. It needs to be changed to third person. For eg, ""You need to run the generator next which will install an initializer and creates all the configuration files"" to something like ""To install the initializer and create the configuration files for a project, the user should run the following command"". For more examples on this, refer to the wikipage on Python's pip installer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)]
- ""There are also many routes that are defined in config/routes.rb with a line like:"" to "" .. with a command like:""

== Modules == 
- ""When a devise generator is invoked a model class is created in app/models for you modify for your specific application requirements."" to ""When a devise generator is invoked, a model class is created in app/models for the user's specific application requirements."" => punctuation: missing comma and removed "".. for you modify for your .."". Not sure if the suggested sentence brings out the same intended meaning.
- Also, the font for ""app/models"" should be changed to 'Computer Code', which can be found in the 'more option' while in the 'Edit' mode.
- ""This is the place where many important configuration changes are specified."" to ""This folder/directory/file contains many of the important configuration .."" => ""This is the place .. "" sounds too informal

This may lead to copyright infringements. The structure of those sentences needs to be changed

== History == 
- Googling ""Since Warden does not know of the existence of the Rails application, it cannot provide any helper methods, controller classes, views etc."" leads to a page (first result) [https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication]. The structure of the quoted sentence is too similar to the one found in the article, which reads ""Warden knows nothing about the existence of your Rails app. As a result, Warden does not provide helper methods, controller classes, views, configuration options .."". As we saw in the wikipedia training, the guidelines does not approve of such similarity. This could probably be changed to something like ""Warden does not provide any kind of helper methods, controller classes, views, configuration options etc, as it is unaware of the existence of Rails or it's structure.""
- The sentence ""Devise interacts often with Warden using Strategy design pattern for encrypting passwords, HTTP Authentication etc"" is too similar to the one found in [https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication]. Could be changed to something like ""A Strategy design pattern is used by Devise for interaction with Warden. This enables it to perform tasks like encrypting ... ""

== Modules ==
- ""When a devise generator is invoked a model class is created in app/models for you modify for your specific application requirements."" -  the sentence is almost the same as the one found in [https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-use-devise-in-rails-for-authentication]",2

Talks about fixtures and its purpose. However, there is no content on the 'need for testing'. Therefore, the heading is slightly misleading

Not sure if this is really required. ""Location of fixtures in the project directory: test/fixtures"" => Doesn't really add anything to the article. However, if there was more about configuration or how to setup the Fixtures, then this sentence would have made sense.
Also, the font for ""test/fixtures"", ""user"", ""admin_user"" could be changed to ""Computer code"" from the 'Edit' mode to differentiate if from normal 'English' words

This paragraph talks about Fixtures in general. Not sure if this was meant to explain where Fixtures lack and Factory Girl is better.
